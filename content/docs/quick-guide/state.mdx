### State

> Deligenus provides a built-in `state`, which works very like the `state` in `React`, but in a application level. If you don't know state works, this post will work you throughout all the basic concepts you should know. 

#### Use `State` as a shared context in `Application`

The following example shows how you can put `Mysql` DB instance as a shared context in every middleware. Any item in `state` is supposed to be **read only**.

```ts
import { Application } from "https://deno.land/x/deligenius/mod.ts";
import { Client } from "https://deno.land/x/mysql/mod.ts";

const db = await new Client().connect({
  hostname: "127.0.0.1",
  username: "root",
  db: "test",
  password: "password",
});

interface State {
  db: Client;
}

// inject State interface into Application
let app = new Application<State>({ port: 8000 }).listen();

app.setState({ db });

// now db is available in state for every middlewares
app.use(async ({ req, res, state }, next) => {
  await state.db.execute(
    `INSERT INTO users(name) values(?)`,
    ["test user" + userCount],
  );
});

```

#### Use `State` as a custom property
