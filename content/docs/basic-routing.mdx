### Basic Routing

> If you are familiar with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/),
> `Router` is your friend.

Route definition:

```ts
router.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
```

Where: 
 - ```METHOD = get | post | put | delete | connect | options | trace | patch```
 - ```PATH: string``` is a path on the server, starts with ```"/"```
 - ```HANDLER: Function``` will execute when the route is matched

### A routing example:

```ts
let router = new Router("/")

app.use(router)

router.get("/", ({ req, res }, next) => {
  res.send("You reached " + req.url)
})
```

#### Explanation of the code:

```ts
let router = new Router("/")
```

We first create a new `Router` for route `"/"`, which means that
everytime a client send HTTP request goes to "http://localhost/", this router
will receive the request.

---

```ts
app.use(router)
```

`app` is an instance of `Application`,
`app.use(router)` activate the router in `app`

---

```ts
router.get("/", ({ req, res }) => {
  res.send("You reached " + req.url)
})
```

`router.get` accepts a `PATH` and `HANDLER`

Where:
- `PATH` = `"/"`
- `HANDLER` = 
```ts
  ({ req, res }) => {
  res.send("You reached " + req.url);
  }
```

When the request hit the ```PATH```, the ```HANDLER``` function executes.
Here out handler sents a message with ```"You reached " + req.url```

#### The complete example 

```ts
import {
  Application,
  Router,
} from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deligenius/deligenius/master/mod.ts";

let app = new Application({ port: 8000 }).listen();
let router = new Router("/");

app.use(router);

router.get("/", ({ req, res }, next) => {
  res.send("You reached " + req.url);
});
```
