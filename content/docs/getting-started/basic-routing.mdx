### Basic Routing

> If you are familiar with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/),
> `Router` is your friend.

Route definition:

```jsx
router.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
```

Where:

- `METHOD = get | post | put | delete | connect | options | trace | patch`
- `PATH: string` is a path on the server, starts with `"/"`
- `HANDLER: Function` will execute when the route is matched

### A routing example

```ts
import {
  Application,
  Router,
} from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deligenius/deligenius/master/mod.ts";

let app = new Application({ port: 8000 }).listen();
let router = new Router("/");

app.use(router);

router.get("/", ({ req, res }, next) => {
  res.send("You reached " + req.url);
});
```

#### Explanation of the code:

```ts
let router = new Router("/")
```

We first create a new `Router` for path `"/"`, which means that
everytime a client send HTTP request goes to "/", this router
will receive the request.

---

```ts
app.use(router)
```

`app` is an instance of `Application`,
`app.use(router)` activate the router.

---

```ts
router.get("/", ({ req, res }) => {
  res.send("You reached " + req.url)
})
```

`router.get(PATH, HANDLER)` accepts `PATH` and `HANDLER`

Where:

- `PATH` = `"/"`
- `HANDLER` =

```ts
({ req, res }) => {
  res.send("You reached " + req.url)
}
```

When the request hit the `PATH`, the `HANDLER` function executes.
Here the handler sends a message with `"You reached " + req.url`
